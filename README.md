`direpack`: a Python 3 library for state-of-the-art statistical dimension reduction techniques
==============================================================================================

This package delivers a `scikit-learn` compatible Python 3 package for sundry state-of-the art multivariate statistical methods, with 
a focus on dimension reduction. 

The categories of methods delivered in this package, are: 
- Projection pursuit dimension reduction (`ppdire`) 
- Sufficient dimension reduction (`sudire`)
- Robust M-estimators for dimension reduction (`sprm`)
each of which are presented as `scikit-learn` compatible objects in the corresponding folders.

We hope that this package leads to scientific success. If it does so, we kindly ask to cite the [official `direpack` publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235271102200200X) \[0\], as well as the original publication of the corresponding method.  

The package also contains a set of tools for pre- and postprocessing: 
- The `preprocessing` folder provides classical and robust centring and scaling, as well as spatial sign transforms \[4\] and the robbustness inducing wrapping transformation \[15\].  
- The `dicomo` folder contains a versatile class to access a wide variety of moment and co-moment statistics, and statistics derived from those. Check out the [dicomo Documentation file](https://github.com/SvenSerneels/direpack/blob/master/docs/dicomo.md) and the [dicomo Examples Notebook](https://github.com/SvenSerneels/direpack/blob/master/examples/dicomo_example.ipynb).
- Plotting utilities in the `plot` folder 
- Cross-validation utilities in the `cross-validation` folder

Methods in the `sprm` folder
----------------------------
- The estimator (`sprm.py`) \[1\]
- The Sparse NIPALS (SNIPLS) estimator \[3\](`snipls.py`)
- Robust M regression estimator (`rm.py`)
- Ancillary functions for M-estimation (`_m_support_functions.py`)

Methods in the `ppdire` folder
------------------------------
The `ppdire` class will give access to a wide range of projection pursuit dimension reduction techniques.
These include slower approximate estimates for well-established methods such as PCA, PLS and continuum regression. 
However, the class provides unique access to a set of robust options, such as robust continuum regression (RCR) \[5\], through its native `grid` optimization algorithm, first 
published for RCR as well \[6\]. Moreover, `ppdire` is also a great gateway to calculate generalized betas, using the CAPI projection index \[7\]. 

The code is orghanized in 
- `ppdire.py` - the main PP dimension reduction class 
- `capi.py` - the co-moment analysis projection index.      

Methods in the `sudire` folder
------------------------------
The `sudire` folder gives access to an extensive set of methods that resort under the umbrella of sufficient dimension reduction. 
These range from meanwhile long-standing, well-accepted approaches, such as sliced inverse regression (SIR) and the closely related SAVE \[8,9\], 
through methods such as directional regression \[10\] and principal Hessian directions \[11\], and more. However, the package also contains some 
of the most recently developed, state-of-the-art sufficient dimension reduction techniques, that require no distributional assumptions. 
The options provided in this category are based on energy statistics (distance covariance \[12\] or martingale difference divergence \[13\]) and 
ball statistics (ball covariance) \[14\]. All of these options can be called by setting the corresponding parameters in the `sudire` class, cf. [the docs](https://github.com/SvenSerneels/direpack/blob/master/docs/sudire.md). 
Note: the ball covariance option will require some lines to be uncommented as indicated. We decided not to make that option generally available, 
since it depends on the `Ball` package that seems to be difficult to install on certain architectures. 

How to install
--------------
The package is distributed through PyPI, so install through: 
        
        pip install direpack
        
Note that some of the key methods in the `sudire` subpackage rely on the IPOPT 
optimization package, which according to their recommendation, can best be installed
directly as: 

        conda install -c conda-forge cyipopt
